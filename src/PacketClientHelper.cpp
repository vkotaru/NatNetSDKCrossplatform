//  Unpack Data:
//      Recieves pointer to bytes that represent a packet of data
//
//      There are lots of print statements that show what
//      data is being stored
//
//      Most memcpy functions will assign the data to a variable.
//      Use this variable at your descretion. 
//      Variables created for storing data do not exceed the 
//      scope of this function.
